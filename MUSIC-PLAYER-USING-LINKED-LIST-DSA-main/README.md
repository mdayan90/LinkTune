# MUSIC-PLAYER-USING-LINKED-LIST-DSA
## ABSTRACT

Music is one of the best ways to relieve pressure in todayâ€™s stressful lifestyle. Media player software is a type of application software for playing multimedia computer files like audio and video files. Music Player is a software that plays audio files encoded in MP3 and other audio formats. On the software side, applications that reside in the user's computer, such as iTunes, Windows Media Player and RealPlayer, are used to organize a music collection, play audio files and rip music from a CD. 
The purpose of the project is to implement a music player app using linked list as a data structure. Here, the linked list data structure is used to store the audio file in the form of MP3 and .WAV format and navigate through different music files. Meanwhile, this software can play, pause and select songs with the use of play/pause, forward and previous button according to the songs, as well as set them up. We can increase or decrease volume using the volume slider. Overall, the use of linked list data structure makes it easy to store and navigate through different audio files, and is easy and simple to build the application. 
The project is implemented using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Here HTML and CSS are used to make the user interface using different slider bars and buttons. Here JavaScript is used to make Doubly Linked List, store the music files in each node, and navigate through them. In addition, actions for each buttons and slider bars are done using JavaScript.

## Concepts used for the Application
Linked List is the data structures that is used in the application, due to its versatility and universality. Linked List can be defined as a collection of objects called nodes that are randomly stored in the memory. More specifically Doubly Linked List is used in the project in order to store the music files and navigate to different nodes thus accessing the music file. Doubly linked list is a complex type of linked list in which a node contains a pointer to the previous as well as the next node in the sequence. Therefore, in a doubly linked list, a node consists of three parts: node data, pointer to the next node in sequence (next pointer), pointer to the previous node (previous pointer).

## Problem Statement
The problem we opted was to develop a Music Player using linked list. Here linked list data structure is used to store the music file in the form of MP3 and .WAV format and navigate through different music files. Meanwhile, this software can play, pause and select songs with the use of forward and previous button according to sets requirement as well as set up song. Additionally, HTML and CSS is used to create the Basic user interface, linked list and button functionalities using JavaScript. 

## Objectives
The main objective of this project is to entirely design a music player application that is user friendly and is easy to navigate through songs using doubly linked list as the data structure and at the same time, learning different data structures and algorithms, tools and disciplines required for the development of the music player application. In order to be able to achieve this main objective, the project has been divided into multiple targets. The general targets include:
- Create a UI for the music player application using HTML and CSS
- Implement Doubly Linked list to store the different music files in each node
- Create suitable buttons and slider bars for navigation of different music
- Store the MP3 and .WAV format music files in linked list using JavaScript and also implement actions to the buttons used and enhance the UI

## METHODOLOGY
To move forward with the project, multiple concepts from HTML, CSS and JavaScript were searched that could be helpful in the development of the music player application. The main part of the project was to implement one of the data structures. In this project, Doubly Linked List is used as one of the Data Structure to store the music files and navigate through different nodes to access the music files. 
The basic UI design consists of a background image, different buttons and slide bars for the navigation of songs and for the adjustment of the volume. A basic flowchart of the, music player is shown below.

 - ## Design
The basic structure and functionality of the project is based on doubly linked list where the music file is stored and is navigated using next and previous buttons. The basic logic of the application is as follows:
- After launching the landing page, the music player user interface is displayed and all the necessary buttons and slider bars are displayed.
- All the necessary actions to the buttons are provided using JavaScript and the music files are stored in a linked list and is navigated using next and previous button.
- Here the music file address is pushed into the node and when the specific music is navigated the music file is played.
- Volume can be adjusted through a slider bar and the music time line track is also viewed through a slider bar.
- In order to indicate the head node and tail node, special button features are implemented.

## OUTPUT
- When the application is started, it is guided to a UI landing page made using HTML and CSS.The UI of the music player has a background image and different buttons and slider bars that has specific control.

 - The music files are stored using doubly linked list and each music file is stored in a node and is used for accessing music files to play. The Buttons are given specific action that can be performed in order to navigate through different music and also pause and play the music. The music timeline is shown through a slider bar and the volume can be adjusted using a slider bar.

## CONCLUSION
The main objective of this project is to entirely design a music player application that is user-friendly and is easy to navigate through songs using doubly linked list as the data structure, and at the same time, learning different data structures and algorithms, tools and disciplines required for the development of the music player application. In order to implement all the features HTML, CSS and JavaScript were used and the required results were achieved. The implementation of the correct data structure, which is the Doubly Linked List and the action for the buttons, was the main part in the project.

As a result, the Music Player application made using Linked List was designed and also the user interface was designed letting the user listen to the music and also made the application user friendly and simple in order to navigate through different songs using different buttons. Special features such as making the previous button BLACK in colour when the music playing is the head node and making the next button to RED indicating to move forward to access the next music file. Also, making the next button BLACK if the music playing is the tail node and the previous button RED indicating to move backward to replay the song again was also implemented, thus, indicating the first and the last nodes of the linked list.
